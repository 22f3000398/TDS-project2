Business Report on Happiness Dataset

Executive Summary
This report analyzes a happiness dataset to uncover key factors influencing life satisfaction across countries and time periods. The analysis highlights critical variables such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and emotional well-being (positive and negative affect). Using summary statistics and correlations, the findings offer actionable insights to improve happiness indicators globally.

Key Findings

1. Strong Positive Correlations

Economic Prosperity and Social Support: "Life Ladder" (a measure of happiness) shows a robust positive correlation with Log GDP per capita (0.78) and Social support (0.72). These findings underscore the importance of financial stability and community connections in enhancing happiness.
Emotional Well-Being: Positive affect has a notable positive correlation with the Life Ladder (0.51), while negative affect shows an inverse relationship (-0.35). This highlights the role of emotional health in life satisfaction.
2. Data Gaps

Variables such as Generosity (81 missing entries) and Perceptions of corruption (125 missing entries) have significant gaps. These omissions could limit the comprehensiveness of analyses, particularly for certain countries or time periods.
3. Longitudinal Insights

The dataset spans from 2005 to 2023, with an average year of 2014.76. This enables exploration of trends in happiness determinants over nearly two decades.
4. Low Generosity Levels

The average generosity score is strikingly low (9.77e-05), pointing to potential challenges in fostering charitable behavior and community support, which could hinder overall happiness.
Surprising Trends

Corruption and Happiness: There is a significant negative correlation (-0.43) between Perceptions of corruption and Life Ladder, suggesting that higher perceived corruption diminishes happiness. This finding emphasizes the importance of improving governance and reducing corruption perceptions to boost societal well-being.
